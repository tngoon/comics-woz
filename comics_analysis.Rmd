Each row is split into condition according to which comic was shown as "Comic A" in each pair. For OrderReversed=TRUE, the adaptive (wizard) comic was shown first; the opposite is true for for OrderReversed=FALSE. Each measure is assigned a 1 or 0 depending if comic A was chosen as the preferred comic for the measure.
